Feature: Mojaloop test

  Scenario: MLT-001 ML connector partial payee party lookup test
    Given I am setting up Mojaloop
    Given I have Fineract-Platform-TenantId for "payee"
    When I call the create client endpoint for "payee"
    Then I call the create savings product endpoint for "payee"

#    Then I will sleep for 5000 millisecond
    Then I should be able to verify the callback for lookup
    Then I can stop mock server

    Then I call the get quotation api in ml connector for "payee"

    Then I can stop mock server

  Scenario: MLT-003 ML connector partial payee transfer test

    Then I call the get quotation api in ml connector for "payee"
#    Then I will sleep for 5000 millisecond
    Then I should be able to verify the callback for quotation
    Then I can register the stub for callback endpoint of transfer
    Then I call the transfer api in ml connector for "payee"
#    Then I will sleep for 5000 millisecond
    Then I should be able to verify the callback for transfer
    Then I can stop mock server

 Scenario Outline: PFT-001 Payer Fund Transfer Flow test
    Given I am setting up Mojaloop
    Given I have Fineract-Platform-TenantId for "payer"
    When I call the create client endpoint for "payer"
    Then I call the create savings product endpoint for "payer"
    When I call the create savings account endpoint for "payer"
    Then I call the interop identifier endpoint for "payer"
    Then I approve the deposit with command "approve" for "payer"
    When I activate the account with command "activate" for "payer"
    Then I call the deposit account endpoint with command "deposit" for amount 12 for "payer"

#    payee1/payee2/payee3
    Given I have Fineract-Platform-TenantId for "<payee>"
    When I call the create client endpoint for "payee"
    Then I call the create savings product endpoint for "payee"
    When I call the create savings account endpoint for "payee"
    Then I call the interop identifier endpoint for "payee"
    Then I approve the deposit with command "approve" for "payee"
    When I activate the account with command "activate" for "payee"
    Then I call the deposit account endpoint with command "deposit" for amount 10 for "payee"

    Then I add "payer" to als
#    payee1/payee2/payee3
    Then I add "<payee>" to als

    Then I call the payer fund transfer api to transfer amount "1" from payer to payee
    Then I should get transaction id in response

#    Then I will sleep for 10000 millisecond

    When I call the transfer API in ops app with transactionId as parameter

    Then I check for error related to lookup
    And I assert the partyLookupFailed is false
    And I assert the partyLookupRetryCount is 0

    Then I check for error related to quote
    And I assert the quoteFailed is false
    And I assert the quoteRetryCount is 0

    Then I check for error related to transfer
    And I assert the transferFailed is false
    And I assert the transferRetryCount is 0

    Then I assert "payer" balance to be 11
    Then I assert "payee" balance to be 11
   Examples:
     | payee |
     | payee1 |
     | payee2 |
     | payee3 |

  Scenario: BTM-001 Bulk Transfer with Mojaloop
    Given I am setting up Mojaloop
    When I create and setup a "payer" with account balance of 12
    When I create and setup a "payee" with account balance of 10
    Then I add "payer" to als
    Then I add "payee" to als
    Then Create a csv file with file name "batchTransaction.csv"
    Then add row to csv with current payer and payee, payment mode as "mojaloop" and transfer amount 3 and id 0
    Then I add "payer" to als
    When I create and setup a "payer" with account balance of 120
    Then add row to csv with current payer and payee, payment mode as "mojaloop" and transfer amount 2 and id 1
    When I create and setup a "payer" with account balance of 66
    When I create and setup a "payee" with account balance of 10
    Then I add "payer" to als
    Then I add "payee" to als
    Then add last row to csv with current payer and payee, payment mode as "mojaloop" and transfer amount 1 and id 2

    Given I have Fineract-Platform-TenantId for "payer"
    And I generate clientCorrelationId
    And I have private key
    And I generate signature
    When I call the batch transactions endpoint with expected status of 202
    And I am able to parse batch transactions response
    And I fetch batch ID from batch transaction API's response
#    Then I will sleep for 10000 millisecond
    When I call the batch aggregate API with expected status of 200 with total 3 txns
    Then I should get non empty response
    Then I am able to parse batch summary response
    And Status of transaction is "COMPLETED"
    And I should have matching total txn count and successful txn count in response
