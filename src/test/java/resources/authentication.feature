Feature: Authentication test for services routed through kong & keycloak

  @keycloak-user-setup @keycloak-user-teardown @kong-teardown
  Scenario: CCT-001 Unauthorized channel-connector test
    Given I have tenant as "paymentBB2"
    And I can mock TransactionChannelRequestDTO
    And I register channel service using config
    And I register channel route using config
    And I enable oidc plugin
    When I call the inbound transfer endpoint with expected status of 401 and no authentication
    Then I should get non empty response
