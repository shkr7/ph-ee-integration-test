Feature: Identity Account Mapper Api Test

  Background: I will start mock server and register stub
    Given I will start the mock server
    And I can register the stub with "/registerBeneficiaryApiTest" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/addPaymentModalityApiTest" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/updatePaymentModalityApiTest" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/accountLookupTest" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/accountLookup" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/batchAccountLookup" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    And I can register the stub with "/updateBeneficiaryApiTest" endpoint for "PUT" request with status of 200
    Then I will update the  mock server and register stub as done
